R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than\\ncontemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue,\\nand the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.[[18][19][20]]\\n\\nMartin said, \"The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from\\n[ourselves\".[[21]] Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval, which focuses on overlapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-medievalism)\\nmedieval history and popular fantasy.[[22][23][24]] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle\\n[between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world.[[25]] In the series, political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil)\\nleaders have mostly been portrayed negatively, as they usually disregard the well-being of the common\\npeople and are guided in their decisions by selfish reasons. Few possible exceptions include Daenerys\\nTargaryen, Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, who have shown concern about the populace. Still, their\\nmethods or commitment to the cause have been criticized.[[26]] Martin explores the relationship between\\ngood and evil through the questions of redemption and character change.[[27]] Unlike in many other\\n[fantasies, the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective.[[20][28]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Narrative_point_of_view)\\n\\nIn early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly\\nkilled off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.[[29]] Martin stated in an interview\\nthat he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\nj, p\\ndeveloped \"plot armor\" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to _Game of Thrones_\\ndeviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.[[29]] In a 2012 study, out of 40\\nrecent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.[[31]] A\\nscientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result of\\nviolence and war.[[32]]\\n\\n### Inspirations and derivations\\n\\nAlthough the series\\'s first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were significant\\nchanges made for later seasons. According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is \"about adapting the series as a\\nwhole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily\\neach of the stops along the way\".[[33]] Aspects of the novels\\' plots and their adaptations are based upon\\n[settings, characters, and events in European history.[[34]] Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_medieval)\\nEurope, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the knights\\'\\n[tournaments.[[35][36]] Like medieval Europe, most of the houses in the series use the patriarchal system of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(medieval))\\n[power.[[37]] The series also includes elements of gothic fiction, including torture tropes.[[38]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction)\\n\\nA principal inspiration for the novels is the English Wars of the Roses (1455–1485) between the houses of\\n[Lancaster and York, reflected in Martin\\'s houses of Lannister and Stark.[[39]] The scheming Cersei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lancaster)\\n[Lannister evokes Isabella, the \"She-Wolf of France\" (1295–1358).[[34]] She and her family, as portrayed in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_of_France)\\nMaurice Druon\\'s historical novel series, _[The Accursed Kings, were a main inspiration of Martin\\'s.[[40]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Kings)_\\n\\nOther historical antecedents of series elements include: Hadrian\\'s Wall (which becomes Martin\\'s Wall),\\nthe Roman Empire and the legend of Atlantis (ancient Valyria and its Doom), Damascus steel (Valyrian\\nSteel), Byzantine Greek fire (\"wildfire\"), the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World (such as the Titan of\\nBraavos and Hightower of Oldtown), Icelandic sagas of the Viking Age (the Ironborn), the Mongol\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n( ) gyp ( y)\\n[Renaissance.[[34]] The series\\'s popularity has been attributed, in part, to Martin\\'s skill at fusing these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Renaissance)\\n[elements into a credible version of alternate history.[[34][41]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history)\\n\\n## Episodes\\n\\n**Originally aired**\\n**Avg.

The literary agent sent Benioff the series\\'s first four_\\n[books.[[54]] Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first novel, A Game of Thrones, shared his enthusiasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones)\\nwith D.

According to Benioff, they\\n[won Martin over by knowing the answer to his question, \"Who is Jon Snow\\'s mother?\"[[56]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow_(character)#Parentage)\\n\\nI had worked in Hollywood myself for about 10 years, from the late \\'80s to the \\'90s. I\\'d been on\\nthe staff of The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. All of my first drafts tended to be too)\\nbig or too expensive. I always hated the process of having to cut. I said, \\'I\\'m sick of this, I\\'m\\ngoing to write something that\\'s as big as I want it to be, and it\\'s going to have a cast of\\ncharacters that go into the thousands, and I\\'m going to have huge castles, and battles, and\\ndragons.\\'\\n\\n— George R. R. Martin, author[[57]]\\n\\nBefore being approached by Benioff and Weiss, Martin already had meetings with other scriptwriters,\\nmost of whom wanted to adapt the series as a feature film. Martin, however, deemed it \"unfilmable\",\\nsaying that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as\\n[three feature films.[[57]] Benioff agreed it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as their](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series))\\nscale is too big for a feature film, and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, \"a\\nfantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That\\nmeans no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that.\"[[20]] Martin was pleased with the suggestion that they\\nadapt it as an HBO series, saying that he \"never imagined it anywhere else\".[[58]]\\n\\nThe series began development in January 2007.[[5]] HBO acquired the television rights to the novels, with\\nBenioff and Weiss as the series\\' executive producers and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention\\nwas for each novel to yield a season\\'s worth of episodes.[[5]] Initially, Martin would write one episode per\\n[season while Benioff and Weiss would write the rest.[[5]] Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Espenson)\\n[later to write one episode each for the first season.[[59]] The first and second drafts of the pilot script by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_episode)\\nBenioff and Weiss were submitted in August 2007[[60]] and June 2008,[[61]] respectively. Although HBO\\n[liked both drafts,[[62]] a pilot was not ordered until November 2008.[[63]] The pilot episode, \"Winter Is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming)\\nComing\", was shot in 2009; after its poor reception following a private viewing, HBO demanded an\\nextensive re-shoot (about 90 percent of the episode, with cast and directorial changes).[[56][64]] The pilot\\nreportedly cost HBO $5–10 million to produce,[[65]] while the first season\\'s budget was estimated at $50–\\n60 million.[[66]] For the second season, the series received a 15-percent budget increase for the climactic\\n[battle in \"Blackwater\" (which had an $8 million budget).[[67][68]] Between 2012 and 2015, the average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_(Game_of_Thrones))\\nbudget per episode increased from $6 million[[69]] to \"at least\" $8 million.[[70]] The sixth-season budget was\\nover $10 million per episode, for a season total of over $100 million, a record for a series\\'s production\\ncost.[[71]] By the final season, the production budget per episode was estimated to be $15 million.[[72]]\\n\\n### Casting\\n\\n[Nina Gold and Robert Sterne were the series\\' primary casting directors.[[73]] Through a process of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Gold)\\nauditions and readings, the main cast was assembled. The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean\\n[Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009.[[74][75]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bean)\\n\\nOther actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon,\\n[Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon.[[75]] According to Benioff and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lloyd)\\nWeiss, Addy was the easiest actor to cast for the series because of his audition performance.[[76]] Some\\ncharacters in the pilot were recast for the first season. The role of Catelyn Stark was played initially by\\n\\n\\n-----\\n\\n, y y g y\\n[also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant.[[78]] The rest of the first season\\'s cast was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Clarke)\\nselected in the second half of 2009.[[79]]\\n\\nAlthough many of the cast returned after the first season, the producers had many new characters to cast\\nin each of the following seasons. Because of the large number of new characters, Benioff and Weiss\\npostponed introducing several key characters in the second season and merged several characters into\\none, or assigned plot functions to different characters.[[9]] Some recurring characters were recast over the\\nyears; for example, Gregor Clegane was played by three different actors, while Dean-Charles Chapman\\nplayed both Tommen Baratheon and a minor Lannister character.[[80]]\\n\\n### Writing\\n\\n_Game of Thrones used seven writers over its six seasons. Benioff_\\nand Weiss wrote most of each season\\'s episodes.[[81]] _A Song of Ice_\\n_and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of_\\nthe first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later\\nseasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel\\n[(The Winds of Winter).[[82]] Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter)\\n[season episode as a freelance writer.[[83]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Golden_Crown)\\n\\nCogman, initially a script coordinator for the series,[[83]] was\\npromoted to producer for the fifth season.

The writers spent several weeks writing a character\\noutline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual\\noutlines were completed, they spent another two to three weeks discussing each main character\\'s\\nindividual arc and arranging them episode by episode.[[81]] A detailed outline was created, with each of the\\nwriters working on part of it to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the\\nfifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They were then read by Benioff and Weiss,\\nwho made notes, and parts of the script were rewritten. All ten episodes were written before filming\\n[began since they were shot out of order by two units in different countries.[[81]] Benioff and Weiss wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew)\\ntheir episodes together; one wrote the first half of the script with the other writing the second half.
