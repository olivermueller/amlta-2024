    "TextWorld was a learning environment for text-based games, specifically designed by Microsoft to support environments for text-based reinforcement agents ([Côté et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1806.11532)). With the publication of TextWorld, Microsoft also published the *First TextWorld Problems Challenge* which included *The Cooking Game*, where text-based agents need to navigate through different rooms, find the recipe in the kitchen, find, cut, cook the ingredients according to the recipe and eat it, using pre-defined text-commands on a diverse set of ingredients ([Microsoft, 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/first-textworld-problems-the-competition-using-text-based-games-to-advance-capabilities-of-ai-agents/)).\n"
