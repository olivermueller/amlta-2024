on the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling
dynasty, who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting
to return and reclaim the throne. The third follows the
Night's Watch, a military order defending the realm
against threats from beyond the Seven Kingdoms'
northern border.

_Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on_
HBO and has a broad, active, and international fan
base. Many critics and publications have named the
show one of the greatest television series of all time.
Critics have praised the series for its acting, complex
characters, story, scope, and production values,
although its frequent use of nudity and violence
(including sexual violence) generated controversy. The

## Premise

### Plot

_Game of Thrones is roughly based on the storylines of_
the _[A Song of Ice and Fire book series by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire)_
[George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional Seven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin)
[Kingdoms of Westeros and the continent of Essos.[[5][6]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Westeros)

The series follows several simultaneous plotlines.[[7]]

[The first story arc follows a war of succession among](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc)
[competing claimants for control of the Iron Throne of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Throne_(A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire))
the Seven Kingdoms, with other noble families
fighting for independence from the throne. The second
[concerns the actions of the exiled scion to reclaim the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineal_descendant)
throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending
[winter, as well as the legendary creatures and fierce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Others_(A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire))
peoples of the North.[[8]]

### Cast and characters

_[Game of Thrones has an ensemble cast which has been](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast)_
estimated to be the largest on television.[[9]] In 2014,
several actors' contracts were renegotiated to include a
seventh-season option.[[10]] By the final season, five of
the main cast members made $1 million per episode,
[making them among the highest paid television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_paid_American_television_stars)
[performers.[[11][12]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_paid_American_television_stars)

### Themes

Both television critics and historians have praised the series for what was perceived as a sort of medieval
realism.[[15][16][17]] George R. R. Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than
contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue,
and the characters, believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre.[[18][19][20]]

[Martin said, "The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc)
[ourselves".[[21]] Academics have classified the series as neo-medieval, which focuses on overlapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-medievalism)
medieval history and popular fantasy.[[22][23][24]] A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle
[between good and evil, which Martin says does not mirror the real world.[[25]] In the series, political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil)
leaders have mostly been portrayed negatively, as they usually disregard the well-being of the common
people and are guided in their decisions by selfish reasons. Few possible exceptions include Daenerys
Targaryen, Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, who have shown concern about the populace. Still, their
methods or commitment to the cause have been criticized.[[26]] Martin explores the relationship between
good and evil through the questions of redemption and character change.[[27]] Unlike in many other
[fantasies, the series allows the audience to view different characters from their perspective.[[20][28]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration#Narrative_point_of_view)

In early seasons, under the influence of the A Song of Ice and Fire books, main characters were regularly
killed off, and this was credited with developing tension among viewers.[[29]] Martin stated in an interview
that he wanted to depict war and violence in a realistic way, which sometimes mean the hero or main

[developed "plot armor" to survive in unlikely circumstances and attributed this to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_armor) _Game of Thrones_
deviating from the novels to become more of a traditional television series.[[29]] In a 2012 study, out of 40
recent television drama shows, Game of Thrones ranked second in deaths per episode, averaging 14.[[31]] A
scientific study conducted in 2018 stated that about 60% of the major characters died as a result of
violence and war.[[32]]

### Inspirations and derivations

Although the series's first season closely follows the events of the first novel, there were significant
changes made for later seasons. According to Benioff, the TV adaptation is "about adapting the series as a
whole and following the map George laid out for us and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily
each of the stops along the way".[[33]] Aspects of the novels' plots and their adaptations are based upon
[settings, characters, and events in European history.[[34]] Most of Westeros is reminiscent of high medieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_medieval)
[Europe, from its geography and castles to its cultures, the feudal system, palace intrigues, and the knights'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism)

## Production

### Conception and development

The A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels was popular
before _Game of Thrones.[[49]] The series has sold more_
than 90 million copies worldwide with the novels being
translated into 45 different languages.[[50][51]]

George R. R. Martin received multiple fantasy writing
[awards and nominations, including a World Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Fantasy_Award)
[Award and multiple Locus Awards, for the series.[[52]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Fantasy_Award)

[Martin the "American Tolkien", stating he is a "major](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien)

books he represented. Having been a fan of fantasy
fiction when he was younger, he became interested in A
_Song of Ice and Fire, which he had not read. The literary agent sent Benioff the series's first four_

[(himself a veteran screenwriter) in a restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard. According to Benioff, they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica_Boulevard)
[won Martin over by knowing the answer to his question, "Who is Jon Snow's mother?"[[56]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow_(character)#Parentage)

I had worked in Hollywood myself for about 10 years, from the late '80s to the '90s. I'd been on
[the staff of The Twilight Zone and Beauty and the Beast. All of my first drafts tended to be too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twilight_Zone_(1985_TV_series))
big or too expensive. I always hated the process of having to cut. I said, 'I'm sick of this, I'm
going to write something that's as big as I want it to be, and it's going to have a cast of
characters that go into the thousands, and I'm going to have huge castles, and battles, and
dragons.'

— George R. R. Martin, author[[57]]

Before being approached by Benioff and Weiss, Martin already had meetings with other scriptwriters,
most of whom wanted to adapt the series as a feature film. Martin, however, deemed it "unfilmable",
[saying that the size of one of his novels is as long as The Lord of the Rings, which had been adapted as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
[three feature films.[[57]] Benioff agreed it would be impossible to turn the novels into a feature film as their](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series))
scale is too big for a feature film, and dozens of characters would have to be discarded. Benioff added, "a
[fantasy movie of this scope, financed by a major studio, would almost certainly need a PG-13 rating. That](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system)
means no sex, no blood, no profanity. Fuck that."[[20]] Martin was pleased with the suggestion that they
adapt it as an HBO series, saying that he "never imagined it anywhere else".[[58]]

The series began development in January 2007.[[5]] HBO acquired the television rights to the novels, with
Benioff and Weiss as the series' executive producers and Martin as a co-executive producer. The intention
was for each novel to yield a season's worth of episodes.[[5]] Initially, Martin would write one episode per
[season while Benioff and Weiss would write the rest.[[5]] Jane Espenson and Bryan Cogman were added](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Espenson)
[later to write one episode each for the first season.[[59]] The first and second drafts of the pilot script by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_episode)
Benioff and Weiss were submitted in August 2007[[60]] and June 2008,[[61]] respectively. Although HBO
[liked both drafts,[[62]] a pilot was not ordered until November 2008.[[63]] The pilot episode, "Winter Is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming)
[Coming", was shot in 2009; after its poor reception following a private viewing, HBO demanded an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Is_Coming)
extensive re-shoot (about 90 percent of the episode, with cast and directorial changes).[[56][64]] The pilot
reportedly cost HBO $5–10 million to produce,[[65]] while the first season's budget was estimated at $50–
60 million.[[66]] For the second season, the series received a 15-percent budget increase for the climactic
[battle in "Blackwater" (which had an $8 million budget).[[67][68]] Between 2012 and 2015, the average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackwater_(Game_of_Thrones))
budget per episode increased from $6 million[[69]] to "at least" $8 million.[[70]] The sixth-season budget was
over $10 million per episode, for a season total of over $100 million, a record for a series's production
cost.[[71]] By the final season, the production budget per episode was estimated to be $15 million.[[72]]

### Casting

[Nina Gold and Robert Sterne were the series' primary casting directors.[[73]] Through a process of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Gold)
[auditions and readings, the main cast was assembled. The only exceptions were Peter Dinklage and Sean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dinklage)
[Bean, whom the writers wanted from the start; they were announced as joining the pilot in 2009.[[74][75]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Bean)

[Other actors signed for the pilot were Kit Harington as Jon Snow, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Harington)
[Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen, and Mark Addy as Robert Baratheon.[[75]] According to Benioff and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lloyd)
Weiss, Addy was the easiest actor to cast for the series because of his audition performance.[[76]] Some
[characters in the pilot were recast for the first season. The role of Catelyn Stark was played initially by](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catelyn_Stark)

[also recast, with Emilia Clarke replacing Tamzin Merchant.[[78]] The rest of the first season's cast was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Clarke)
selected in the second half of 2009.[[79]]

Although many of the cast returned after the first season, the producers had many new characters to cast
in each of the following seasons. Because of the large number of new characters, Benioff and Weiss
[postponed introducing several key characters in the second season and merged several characters into](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_2)
one, or assigned plot functions to different characters.[[9]] Some recurring characters were recast over the
[years; for example, Gregor Clegane was played by three different actors, while Dean-Charles Chapman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Clegane)
played both Tommen Baratheon and a minor Lannister character.[[80]]

### Writing

_Game of Thrones used seven writers over its six seasons. Benioff_
and Weiss wrote most of each season's episodes.[[81]] _A Song of Ice_
_[and Fire author George R. R. Martin wrote one episode in each of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin)_
the first four seasons. Martin did not write an episode for the later
seasons, since he wanted to focus on completing the sixth novel
[(The Winds of Winter).[[82]] Jane Espenson co-wrote one first-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter)
[season episode as a freelance writer.[[83]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Golden_Crown)

Cogman, initially a script coordinator for the series,[[83]] was
promoted to producer for the fifth season. Cogman, who wrote at
least one episode for the first five seasons, was the only other
writer in the writers' room with Benioff and Weiss.[[81]] Before
[Cogman's promotion, Vanessa Taylor—a writer during the second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Taylor)
[and third seasons—worked closely with Benioff and Weiss. Dave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Hill_(screenwriter))

[George R. R. Martin, author of A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin)

writers; for example, Cogman was assigned to Arya Stark for the
fourth season. The writers spent several weeks writing a character
outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual
outlines were completed, they spent another two to three weeks discussing each main character's
individual arc and arranging them episode by episode.[[81]] A detailed outline was created, with each of the
writers working on part of it to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the
fifth season, took a month and a half to complete both scripts. They were then read by Benioff and Weiss,
who made notes, and parts of the script were rewritten. All ten episodes were written before filming
[began since they were shot out of order by two units in different countries.[[81]] Benioff and Weiss wrote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew)
their episodes together; one wrote the first half of the script with the other writing the second half. They
then passed the drafts back and forth to make notes and do rewrites.[[58]]

was based on a plot outline of the future novels provided by Martin along with original content.[[85][86]]

Before season four, Martin stated there was an issue with the television series being released before the
source material could be written.[[87]] According to Benioff, Martin gave the showrunners an outline on the
final two books of the series.[[88]] In April 2016, the showrunners' plan was to shoot 13 more episodes after
the sixth season: seven episodes in the seventh season and six episodes in the eighth.[[89]] Later that month,
the series was renewed for a seventh season with a seven-episode order.[[90][91]] HBO announced in June
2016 that the eighth season would be the final for the series.[[92]]

The first two seasons adapted one novel each. For the later seasons, its creators saw Game of Thrones as
an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire as a whole rather than the individual novels,[[101]] enabling them to
move events across novels as the screen adaptation required.[[102]]

The show was shot in the United Kingdom, Canada, Croatia,
Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain.

filming the entire series in Scotland, but decided on Northern Ireland because of the availability of studio
space and tax credits.[[107]]

The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change
in location from the pilot episode's Moroccan sets.[[103]] The city of
[Mdina was used for King's Landing.[[108]] Filming also took place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdina)
[at Fort Manoel (representing the Sept of Baelor); at the Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Manoel)

the second season's southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia,
[where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubrovnik)

jobs between 2008 and 2013 (compared with 4.3 percent in the rest of the UK during the same
period).[[130]] After filming had finished, HBO converted its filming locations in Northern Ireland into
tourist attractions to be opened in 2019.[[131]] By 2019, 350,000 visitors, or one sixth of all tourists, came
to Northern Ireland annually because of Game of Thrones.[[132]]

after episodes aired.[[135]] However, the increase in tourism driven by the series—estimated to be
[responsible for half of its annual increase over many years—led to concerns about "over-tourism" and its](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtourism)
mayor imposing limits on tourist numbers in the city.[[119][136]] Following the series finale, HBO
announced in April 2019 a new exhibition and tourist attraction containing show props and set
pieces.[[137]] The attraction, titled _Game of Thrones Studio Tour, will be located at former show filming_
location Linen Mill Studios outside Belfast.[[138]] Studies showed that the series had an overall positive
economic impact for both Northern Ireland and Dubrovnik.[[139][140]] Despite the positive economic
results, some academics note the impact and damage from _Game of Thrones–related tourist activities_
[could have on historical sites and other locations of cultural value.[[141]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_site)

### Directing

[The designs for the series's costumes were inspired by several sources, such as Japanese and Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_armor)
[armor.[[157][158]] Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made of fish skins to resemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin)

neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses were designed for
easy removal.[[159]] All the clothing used during the production was aged for two weeks, so it had a
realistic appearance on high-definition television.[[160]]

About two dozen wigs were used by the actresses. Made of human hair and up to 61 centimetres (2 ft) in
length, they cost up to $7,000 each and were washed and styled like real hair. Applying the wigs was
time-consuming; Emilia Clarke, for example, required about two hours to style her brunette hair with a
platinum-blonde wig and braids. Other actors, such as Jack Gleeson and Sophie Turner, received frequent
[hair coloring. For characters such as Daenerys (Clarke) and her Dothraki, their hair, wigs and costumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_coloring)
were processed to appear as if they had not been washed for weeks.[[159]]

Targaryen's dragons, with the average production time per season of 20 to 22 weeks.[[166]] For the fifth
[season, HBO added Canadian-based Image Engine and US-based Crazy Horse Effects to its list of main](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Engine)
visual-effects producers.[[167][168]] Visual effect supervisor Joe Bauer said that the VFX team worked on
more than "10,000 shots of visual effects" throughout all eight seasons.[[169]] More than 300 artists worked
[on the show's visual effects team.[[170]] The show won eight Creative Arts Emmy Awards for visual effects,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Arts_Emmy_Award)
winning for Outstanding Special Visual Effects in seven consecutive seasons.[[171][172]]

**Title sequence**

[The series's title sequence was created for HBO by production studio Elastic.[[173]] Creative director Angus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_sequence)
[Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Wall)

[on the inside of a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere.[[175]] As the camera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armillary_sphere)

[intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Game_of_Thrones)
[music, the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Game_of_Thrones)
[seconds with the title card and brief opening credits detailing the episode's writer(s) and director. Its](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_credits)
composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less
prominently or not at all.[[175][176]] _[Entertainment Weekly named the title sequence one of the best on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly)_
television, calling it an "all-inclusive cruise of Westeros".[[177]]

### Music

[Ramin Djawadi composed the series's music. The first season's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramin_Djawadi)

[published by Varèse Sarabande in June 2011.[[179]] Soundtrack albums for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Var%C3%A8se_Sarabande)

### Language

The Westerosi characters of Game of Thrones speak British-accented English, often (but not consistently)
with the accent of the English region corresponding to the character's Westerosi region.[[184]] The
[Northerner Eddard Stark speaks in actor Sean Bean's native northern accent, and the southern lord Tywin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_accent)
[Lannister speaks with a southern accent, while characters from Dorne speak English with a Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation)
accent.[[185][186]] Characters foreign to Westeros often have a non-British accent.[[187]]

Although the common language of Westeros is represented as English, the producers charged linguist
[David J. Peterson with constructing Dothraki and Valyrian languages based on the few words in the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_J._Peterson)
novels.[[188][189]] Before production, Peterson wrote 300 pages of Dothraki language material, including
translation and word function.[[190]] Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue is often subtitled in English.[[191]]

[Language-learning company Duolingo began offering courses in High Valyrian in 2017,[[192]] of which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duolingo)

sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy, especially in countries where Game of Thrones was
not televised. Series co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the series was expensive to
produce and "if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist". However, he was pleased that so
many people "enjoy the show so much they can't wait to get their hands on it."[[243]]

season, the fantasy skein was a gamble that has paid off handsomely."[[269]] The second season was also
well received. _Entertainment Weekly praised its "vivid, vital, and just plain fun" storytelling[[270]] and,_
according to The Hollywood Reporter, the series made a "strong case for being one of TV's best series";

with another singling out Arya Stark's story arc.[[279]]

As the seasons progressed, due to lack of new material from the books the show became less character
driven and more reliant on big twists and spectacle.[[280]] The show's final two seasons, especially season
eight, received more criticism. Season seven was praised for its action sequences and focused central
characters, but received criticism for its pace and plot developments that were said to have "defied
[logic".[[257][256][281]] Writing for Vox, Emily VanDerWerff cited the departure from the source material as a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_(website))
reason for the "circular storytelling".[[282]] Critical reception for season eight was mixed.[[283]] _[The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)_

were praised.[[289][290]]

The cast performances were praised throughout the show's run. Peter Dinklage's "charming, morally
[ambiguous, and self-aware"[[291]] portrayal of Tyrion, which earned him Emmy and Golden Globe awards,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Supporting_Actor_in_a_Drama_Series)
was acclaimed. "In many ways, Game of Thrones belongs to Dinklage", wrote Mary McNamara of the
_[Los Angeles Times before Tyrion became the series's central figure in season two.[[292][293]] Several critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times)_
highlighted performances by actresses and children.[[292][294]] Lena Headey's portrayal of the "riveting"
Cersei Lannister also received praise.[[291][295]] Maisie Williams was singled out as well and her season
two work with veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister).[[296]] Stephen Dillane received positive
reviews for his performance as Stannis Baratheon, especially in the fifth season, with one critic noting
"Whether you like Stannis or not, you have to admit that Stephen Dillane delivered a monumental
performance this season."[[297]] The series was also praised for the portrayal of handicapped and disabled
[characters.[[298]] One commentator stated that Tyrion Lannister is a "departure from the archetypal dwarf"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_(mythology))
often found in other fantasy stories like The Lord of the Rings.[[299]]

Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a 'B' rating, saying that it was ultimately "okay".
With both "transcendent moments" and "miserable phases", it was "beloved enough to be criticized by
everyone for something". Franich described seasons three and four as "relentless", seasons six's ending
having a "killer one-two punch", while seasons seven and eight were "indifferent".[[300]] _[The New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times)_

their lack of complexity and a meandering plot.[[301]] The show, however, appeared on many "best of" lists
[for the end of the 2010s. Alan Sepinwall, writing for Rolling Stone, placed the series on his "50 Best TV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010s#Television)
Shows of the 2010s" list, saying its "ability to most of the time keep all of its disparate threads feeling
vital and tied to one another, remains a staggering achievement".[[302]]

**Concerns over depiction of sex and violence**

Despite its otherwise enthusiastic reception by critics, _Game of Thrones has been criticized for the_
[amount of female nudity, violence, and sexual violence it depicts, and for the manner in which it depicts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence)
these themes.[[303][304]] George R. R. Martin responded that he felt obliged to be truthful about history and
human nature, and that rape and sexual violence are common in war; and that omitting them from the
narrative would have rung false and undermined one of his novels' themes, its historical realism.[[305]]

HBO said that they "fully support the vision and artistry of Dan and David's exceptional work and we feel
this work speaks for itself".[[21]] The show has reportedly been censored or banned for sexual or violent
content in countries like China,[[306][307]] India,[[308][309]] Iran,[[310]] Jordan,[[311]] Singapore,[[312]]

Turkey,[[313][314]] United Arab Emirates,[[315]] and Vietnam.[[316]]

The amount of sex and nudity in the series, especially in scenes incidental to the plot, was the focus of
[much of the criticism aimed at it in its first and second seasons. Stephen Dillane, who portrays Stannis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_season_1)
Baratheon, likened the series's frequent explicit scenes to "German porn from the 1970s".[[317]] The series's
[use of "sexposition", plot delivery accompanied by sex or nudity, was criticized as distracting.[[318]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexposition)

_[Saturday Night Live parodied this aspect of the adaptation in a sketch that portrayed a 13-year-old boy as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live)_

["torture porn".[[321]] According to one commentator, although the series' violence tended to serve a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture_porn)
narrative purpose, Theon's torture in the episode was excessive as well.[[322]] One commentator noted that
Greyjoy's emasculation was one of the few sexual assault scenes where a male was the victim.[[323]] A
[scene in the fourth season's episode "Breaker of Chains", in which Jaime Lannister rapes his sister and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_of_Chains)
lover Cersei in the tomb of their dead son, triggered a broad public discussion about the series' depiction
of sexual violence against women. According to Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times, the scene caused
outrage, in part because of comments by director Alex Graves that the scene became "consensual by the
end".[[21]] _Game of Thrones has been criticized for adding scenes of rape that were not included in the_
novels, such as the rape of Craster's daughters by the mutinous members of the Night's Watch.[[324]] Sonia
Saraiya of _[The A.V. Club wrote that the series's choice to portray this sexual act, and a similar one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club)_
between Daenerys Targaryen and Khal Drogo in the first season—both described as consensual in the
source novels—as a rape appeared to be an act of "exploitation for shock value".[[325]]

[In the fifth season's episode "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken", Sansa Stark is raped by Ramsay Bolton.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbowed,_Unbent,_Unbroken)
Most reviewers and publications found the scene gratuitous and artistically unnecessary.[[326][327][328]] In

rape" and general nudity throughout the series.[[323]] Another commentator stated the use of both sex and
[violence helps perpetuate misogyny within the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) _Game of Thrones universe.[[334]] Sophie Turner, who_
portrayed Sansa Stark, has spoken about the long-term impact she believed filming the "heavy" scenes
would have on her and revealed that she developed coping mechanisms to help her through filming.[[335]]

**Lighting**

The lighting, or lack of light, in darker scenes has been a recurring point of criticism since season six of
the series.[[336][337][338][339]] In 2016, _[Bustle's Caitlyn Callegari listed 31 examples of scenes where the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustle_(magazine))_
lighting caused viewers problems ranging from not being able to tell a character's hair color to being
unable to see what was going on.[[340]] Some reviewers have noted this is part of a wider trend[[341]] among
shows that are made by people who have experience working primarily on films, suggesting they "haven't
grasped the nuances (or lack thereof)" of television as a medium, especially the differences between
watching a scene on a television screen versus watching it on the big screen in a movie theater.[[342]]

[In a 2017 interview, Robert McLachlan, a cinematographer working on the show, explained the lack of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McLachlan_(cinematographer))
lighting as an artistic choice saying "we're trying to be as naturalistic as possible".[[343]] The criticism
[reached a high point during "The Long Night", the third episode of season eight.[[344][345]] Barely minutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Night_(Game_of_Thrones))
into the episode, viewers took to social media sites such as Twitter to express their discontent over the
fact that they were having severe difficulties watching the battle and trying to figure out what was going
on.[[346][347]]

### Cultural influence

Although Game of Thrones was initially dismissed by some critics,[[15]] its success has been credited with
[an increase in the fantasy genre's popularity.[[348]] The series's popularity led to increased sales of the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Sales) _A_

[fantasy as a mass-market genre; they are "gateway drugs to fantasy fan culture".[[351]] The show's success](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_drugs)
[led to the commissioning of several fantasy television series, including The Wheel of Time and The Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time_(TV_series))
_[of the Rings: The Rings of Power by Amazon Studios.[[352]] According to Neil Gaiman, whose novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Rings_of_Power)_
_[Good Omens and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series))_ _[American Gods were adapted for television,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gods_(TV_series))_ _Game of Thrones helped to change_
attitudes towards fantasy on television, but mainly it made big budgets for fantasy series more
acceptable.[[353]]

The success of the genre has been attributed by writers to a longing for escapism in popular culture,
frequent female nudity and a skill in balancing lighthearted and serious topics (dragons and politics, for
example) which provided it with a prestige enjoyed by conventional, top-tier drama series.[[15]] According
[to The Daily Beast, Game of Thrones was a favorite of sitcom writers and the series has been referred to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast)
in other television series.[[354]] With other fantasy series, it has been cited as a reason for an increase in the

_Game of Thrones successor series;[[441]] the writers were to be working individually with_
George R. R. Martin, who also co-wrote two of the scripts.[[442]] D. B. Weiss and David Benioff said that
they would not be involved with any of the projects.[[443]]

Martin said that all the concepts under discussion were prequels, although he believes the term "successor
show" applies better to these projects, as they are not Game of Thrones spin-offs in the traditional sense.
He ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible
idea and revealed that some may be set outside Westeros.[[444]] In September 2018, speaking about the four
projects (i.e. not about Goldman's project), HBO president of programming Casey Bloys said that some
of them had been abandoned completely, while others remained as possibilities for the future;[[445]] Martin
said that: "at least two of them are solidly based on material in Fire & Blood".[[446]] In May 2019, Martin
stated that two of the projects were still in the script stage, but were "edging closer".[[447]] In April 2019,
Cogman confirmed his prequel would not be moving forward.[[448]]

[Nymeria, who later founds Dorne; 9 Voyages aka The Sea Snake (from Bruno Heller), about the voyages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Heller)
of Corlys Velaryon on his vessel the Sea Snake; and a project based on Flea Bottom, the poorest slum in
[King's Landing.[[452][453]] In June 2022, it was reported that a Jon Snow sequel series with Kit Harington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Snow_(character))
to reprise his role was in early development at HBO.[[454]] The working title was _Snow and Martin_
confirmed his involvement with the project and that Harington initiated the idea.[[453]] In April 2024,
however, Harington stated the show had been shelved because they could not find a story that excited
them enough.[[455]] In April 2023, it was reported that a series based on Aegon Targaryen's conquest of
Westeros was in development.[[456]] In December 2023, it was announced that _The Sea Snake is being_
developed as an animated series, having been previously announced as a live action series.[[457]]

On June 8, 2018, HBO commissioned a pilot to a _Game of Thrones prequel series from Goldman as_
showrunner and Martin as co-creator.[[458]] The prequel was to take place in the Age of Heroes, a period
that begins roughly 10,000 years before the events of _Game of Thrones. Notable events of that period_
include the foundation of powerful Houses, the Long Night when the White Walkers first descended upon
Westeros, and the Andal Invasion when the Andals invaded from Essos and conquered most of
Westeros.[[459]] Martin suggested _[The Long Night as a title for the series.[[460]] S. J. Clarkson was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._J._Clarkson)_

something wrong with my television? Surely there is some other setting that would brighten

watched on very large screens in very dark rooms, while most TV is watched on smaller
screens in brightly lit rooms. It seems the people making these shows aren't evaluating the
lighting for the proper venue."
