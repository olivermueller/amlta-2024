# How I Met Your Mother

**_How I Met Your Mother (often abbreviated as_** **_HIMYM) is an American_**
[sitcom created by Craig Thomas and Carter Bays for CBS. The series, which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom)
[aired from September 19, 2005 to March 31, 2014, follows main character Ted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby)
[Mosby and his group of friends in New York City's Manhattan. As a frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby)
[story, Ted (in 2030) recounts to his daughter Penny and son Luke the events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story)
[from September 2005 to May 2013 that led to him meeting their mother.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother))

The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they
both lived in New York.[[1]] The vast majority of the episodes (196 out of 208)
[were directed by Pamela Fryman. The other directors were Rob Greenberg (7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamela_Fryman)
[episodes), Michael Shea (4 episodes), and Neil Patrick Harris (1 episode).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris)

Known for its non-contemporary structure, humor, and incorporation of
dramatic elements, How I Met Your Mother was popular throughout its run. It
received positive reviews initially, but reception became more mixed as the
seasons went on.[[2][3][4]] The show was nominated for 91 awards and received
21.

## Premise

[The series follows the adventures of Ted Mosby (played by Josh Radnor) and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby)
[his love life as a single man. His stories are narrated by Bob Saget as Ted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Saget)
Mosby 25 years later as he tells them to his adolescent children, Luke and
Penny.

The story goes into a flashback and starts in 2005 with 27-year-old Ted Mosby
[living in New York City and working as an architect. The narrative deals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City)
[primarily with his best friends. These include the long-lasting couple Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Eriksen)
[Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Eriksen)
kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when
[Marshall proposes, as well as womanizing playboy Barney Stinson (Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womanizing)
[Patrick Harris), and Canadian news reporter Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris)
[Smulders). All of the characters' lives are entwined. The series explores many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobie_Smulders)
story-lines, including a "will they or won't they" relationship between Robin
and each of the two single male friends, Marshall and Lily's relationship, and
the ups and downs of the characters' careers.

[The show's frame story depicts Ted (voice of Bob Saget, uncredited) verbally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story)
[retelling the story to his son Luke (David Henrie) and daughter Penny (Lyndsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Henrie)
[Fonseca) as they sit on the couch in the year 2030. This future-set frame is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndsy_Fonseca)
officially the show's "present day", and How I Met Your Mother exploits this
framing device in numerous ways: to depict and re-depict events from multiple
[points of view; to set up jokes using quick and sometimes multiple flashbacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative))
nested within the oral retelling; to substitute visual, verbal, or aural
euphemisms for activities Ted does not want to talk about with his children
(sexual practices, use of illicit substances, vulgar language, etc.).

While the traditional love story structure begins when the romantic leads first
encounter each other, _How I Met Your Mother does not introduce Ted's wife_
[(Cristin Milioti) until the eighth-season finale and only announces her full](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristin_Milioti)
[name, Tracy McConnell, during the series finale. Her first name, Tracy, is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_McConnell)

factors and scenes in the show that hint various hardships in the show like the
death of Marshall's father, Tracy(Ted's future wife) death and many more. This
leads to audience getting hints to understand what is coming next in the show.

## Production

_How I Met Your Mother was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea_
to "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York", where
they previously worked as writers for _[Late Show with David Letterman,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Show_with_David_Letterman)_
among others.[[1]] The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters.
Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on
Thomas and his wife.[[5][6]] Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to
[have a character based on her but agreed if they could get Alyson Hannigan to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyson_Hannigan)
play her. Hannigan was looking to do more comedy work and was available.[[5]]

[Josh Radnor and Jason Segel, who were cast as Ted and Marshall,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Radnor)
respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on
[the short-lived Freaks and Geeks and a recurring guest star on Judd Apatow's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaks_and_Geeks)
[follow-up show, Undeclared. The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undeclared)
["John Belushi-type character"[[7]] before Neil Patrick Harris won the role after](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Belushi)
being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.[[8]]

[Pamela Fryman invited Bob Saget to be the voice-over narrator, Future Ted,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Saget)
[explaining to him that the show would be like The Wonder Years but "kind of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wonder_Years)
into the future".[[9]] Saget either went to the television studio and recorded the
narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded with
[the episode if necessary.[[10]] He normally did not attend table readings but did](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_read)
so for the last episode.[[11]]

In multiple interviews Bays and Thomas have stated that "a pretty famous
actress"[[12]] turned down the role of Robin, who they revealed in February
[2014 was Jennifer Love Hewitt.[[13]] They then cast the unknown Cobie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Love_Hewitt)
[Smulders; Bays and Thomas later said, "Thank God we did for a million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobie_Smulders)
reasons... when Ted's seeing her for the first time, America's seeing her for the
first time—the intrigue of that propelled the show going forward and kept the
[show alive".[[12]] Although Ted is initially smitten by Robin in the pilot, it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother))
quickly established at the end of the episode that she is not the mother, which
Thomas said was done so they would not repeat the "will they or won't they"
[Ross and Rachel storyline from Friends.[[6]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends)

[According to an Entertainment Weekly article, the writers adopted facets of each main actor's personality and incorporated them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly)
[into their characters. This includes Neil Patrick Harris' skills with magic, Jason Segel's passion for songwriting, Alyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Patrick_Harris)
[Hannigan's absent-mindedness while pregnant, and Josh Radnor's intellectualism.[[14]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyson_Hannigan)

MacLaren's, an Irish bar in the middle of New York City, in which a lot of the show is set, is loosely based on four favorite bars
[of Bays, Thomas, and others' from the Late Show staff. Others include: McGee's, a Midtown tavern near the Ed Sullivan Theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan_Theater)
[where the Late Show is taped; McHale's, a legendary Hell's Kitchen bar which closed in 2006; Chumley's, a since-closed historic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Kitchen)
[Greenwich Village pub; and Fez, another closed bar on the Upper West Side.[[15]] McGee's had a mural that Bays and Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural)
both liked and wanted to incorporate into the show.[[16]] The name for the bar is from Carter Bays' assistant, Carl MacLaren; the
bartender in the show is also named Carl.[[17]]

[Episodes were generally shot over a three-day period in the Los Angeles-based Soundstage Studio 22[[18]] and featured upwards of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles)
[50 scenes with quick transitions and flashbacks. However, the "Pilot" episode was filmed at CBS Radford.[[19]] The laugh track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative))
was later created by recording an audience being shown the final edited episode. Thomas claimed that shooting before a live
[audience would have been impossible because of the structure of the show and the numerous flashforwards in each episode and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashforward)
because doing so "would blur the line between 'audience' and 'hostage situation'".[[20]] Later seasons started filming in front of an
audience on occasion, when smaller sets were used.


-----

[generally started with the opening credits. A cold opening has been used since season 2. Viewers then occasionally see Ted's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_open)
children on a couch and hear him talking to them, telling the story of how he met their mother. Alternatively, scenes from
previous episodes or shots of New York City with Ted narrating over the top are shown. Thomas has stated that Future Ted is an
[unreliable narrator, since he is trying to tell a story that happened over 20 years earlier;[[21]] this has been a plot point in several](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreliable_narrator)
[episodes including "The Goat", "Oh Honey", "How I Met Everyone Else", and "The Mermaid Theory". Nevertheless, Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goat_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother))
has also emphasized maintaining a coherent and consistent universe and trying to avoid continuity errors, a problem he noticed in
other shows.[[22]]

[A scene relating to the identity of the mother, involving Ted's future children, was filmed in 2006 for the show's eventual series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale)
[finale.[[23]] This was done because the teenage actors portraying them would be adults by the time the final season was shot.[[21]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale)

[During the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, How I Met Your Mother shut down production; when the strike ended,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike)
[the show returned on March 17, 2008, with nine new episodes.[[24]] The network announced a change in the timeslot to 8:30 pm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_United_States_network_television_schedule#Monday)
ET/7:30 pm CT, flip-flopping from the summer schedule with _[The Big Bang Theory.[[25]] CBS renewed the show for a fourth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)_
season on May 14, 2008,[[26]] which premiered on September 22, 2008.[[27]]

[In September 2008, Lifetime Television announced it had purchased the cable rerun rights to How I Met Your Mother at a rate of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network))
about $725,000 per episode.[[28]] The four-year syndication contract stipulated that the studio deliver at least 110 half-hour
episodes by 2010 and allowed for up to eight seasons of the show. At the end of the fourth season only 88 episodes had been
produced, and a further 22 episodes were required, ensuring that there would be a fifth season.[[29]] There also was a complication
with the writing of the show because of actress Alyson Hannigans absence due to her pregnancy; in response, the writers had to
create episodes that did not include one of the five main characters.[[30]] On May 19, 2009, the fifth-season renewal was
announced.[[31]] May 20, 2009, CBS announced that How I Met Your Mother would again be aired at 8 pm, leading into the new
comedy _[Accidentally on Purpose. On January 12, 2010, the show aired its 100th episode, and CBS announced that the series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidentally_on_Purpose_(TV_series))_
would return for a sixth season.[[32]] Upon learning that the series would be syndicated, Thomas said, "We're thrilled that it will
live on in other forms," and they were proud of the show and it was great to see the strong demand.[[33]]

[Reruns of the series began airing on local American broadcast television stations and on Chicago-based cable superstation WGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago)
[America on September 14, 2010. Featured in these airings are vanity cards previously unseen in the CBS and Lifetime airings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGN_America)
[due to marginalized credit sequences used by the two networks. Shown in between the closing credits and the production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalized_closing_credits)
company credits, these vanity cards show portions of "The Bro Code", a list of rules frequently referenced by Harris' character,
Barney Stinson, on how men should interact with each other, with an emphasis on activities involving pursuing members of the
opposite sex. The opening theme song for the syndicated reruns is also slightly edited, running shorter and not using all the
pictures seen in the opening montage that runs on DVD and the original CBS broadcasts. The episodes are also slightly shorter,
to allow for more commercials during a timeslot in syndication.

[One of the series' traditions involved giving guest roles to actors from various Joss Whedon productions, many of whom co-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon)
[starred with Hannigan on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Bays attributed this to their being "huge fans" and to those casts representing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)
"a big talent pool".[[34]]

On March 4, 2011, CBS announced that the show had been renewed for two more seasons,[[35]] with the seventh season
premiering with back-to-back episodes on September 19, 2011.[[36]]

[On July 27, 2011, the FX channel announced it had picked up the series for syndication. On September 5, 2011, FX began airing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX_(TV_channel))
the series.[[37]]

Cast members had said the show would not run longer than eight seasons,[[38]] but a ninth season was secured in December 2012
amid tense negotiations with the studios and the actors—especially Segel, who had wanted to move on to other ventures after the
eighth season.[[39][40]] During these negotiations, Bays and Thomas originally approached the eighth season as if it were the
show's last, but had a "Plan B" in case the show were renewed.[[41]] After producers secured a ninth season, they implemented
[plans to secretly cast the titular future mother, with Cristin Milioti eventually winning the role, having bested at least two other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristin_Milioti)
[contenders.[[12]] Milioti first appeared in the last scene in the season eight finale "Something New" and was a regular cast member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_New_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother))
in the show's final season.[[42]] This was the first time the show had expanded its core roster.[[42][43]]

[In January 2013, How I Met Your Mother was renewed for a ninth season.[[44]] Carter Bays told Entertainment Weekly that season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly)
9 would "feature some of the most non-linear episodes we've ever done".[[45]]

quest for happiness and "The One", the woman he will marry. He has many relationships, one with Robin, that
reveal the qualities he wants in his future wife. At the end of each relationship, with levity, he reflects on what

has more elegant and higher-class interests than his friends. He goes to great lengths to profess his love to the
women in his life, but they all falter eventually. Despite these qualities, Ted often acts immaturely, such as in wild
activities with Barney. In the show's finale, he says that, in Tracy, he had met the love of his life (the titular

### Season 1

[In 2030, Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) sits his children down to tell them the story of how he met their mother.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby)

[The series begins in September 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living with his two best friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Radnor)
[from his college years: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Segel)
and an aspiring artist. Lily and Marshall have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall finally proposes. Their
engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend
[Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris), whom he met in the restroom at a bar four years earlier. Barney is a serial womanizer who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barney_Stinson)
concocts elaborate con games, usually involving costumes and fake identities, designed to bed women, only to lose interest in

apartment, the morning after spending the night with Robin for the first time, to find Marshall sitting in the rain with Lily's
engagement ring, devastated by their sudden break-up after nine years. Marshall must then call off their wedding.

[The phrase olive theory is most known for its appearance in the "pilot" episode.[[48]] In the scene, Ted tells the story of his first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_theory)
date with Robin to Lily and Marshall.[[48]] Ted states that since he does not like olives but his date does, they are compatible.[[47]]

Lily and Marshall add on that the olive theory works in their relationship, as Marshall always gives Lily his olives.[[47]] However,
it is later said that Ted only pretended not to like them to make Robin happy.[[47]]

### Season 2

Ted and Robin are now a couple; meanwhile, a heartbroken Marshall tries to continue his life without Lily. After enduring
numerous emotional breakdowns, Marshall's friends step in, and Barney, using sly catchphrases and pick-up lines, tries to get
Marshall back in the dating game. Marshall becomes Barney's new ‘wingman’ as Ted is now in a relationship with Robin. Barney
mentors Marshall in the art of flirting with women. Marshall fails at impressing women, but he finally obtains a barista's number.
Later, Lily, after finally realizing she is not meant to be an artist, returns to New York. They remain separated as Marshall begins
to date another girl, the barista whose number he earned, described by the gang as having 'crazy eyes'. The date with the girl does
not end well and eventually leads to Lily and Marshall becoming reunited, and their engagement eventually resumes. When
Robin refuses to go to the mall or explain why, Marshall suspects she is married, and Barney suspects she has performed in adult
films. They make a slap bet on it, appointing Lily as "Slap Bet Commissioner." Lily oversees the search for the truth, as they
discover that Robin was a teenage pop star named "Robin Sparkles", and Marshall eventually earns the right to slap Barney five
[times whenever he wishes. He uses one slap immediately and another later in the season. It is revealed that Barney has a gay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual)
[African American half-brother named James (Wayne Brady) and, unaware that his mother lied to him, believes that Bob Barker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American)
[is his father. As a result of this he takes a trip to California to be a contestant on The Price Is Right to meet his "father". While on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right)
the show, Barney wins all the prizes and gives them to Lily and Marshall as a 'happy early wedding' present.

In the season finale, Ted reveals to Barney that he and Robin have been broken up for some time due to their conflicting views on
marriage and children. They did not tell anyone, in order to avoid taking attention away from Lily and Marshall's wedding. The
season ends with Barney's excitement by the prospect of being an unfettered single man with Ted again. Barney's final words are
"this is going to be legen- wait for it...".

### Season 3

[Barney begins the season with the word, "-dary!" Robin returns from a trip to Argentina with her new boyfriend, Gael (Enrique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina)

Lily decide to move out on their own, falling in love with a place they cannot afford. Marshall is fighting his temptation to take a
corporate job with high pay and focusing instead to follow his dream of becoming an environmental lawyer to protect the world
from pollution. Robin learns of Lily's bad credit rating due to her compulsive shopping for designer brands, and forces Lily to tell
Marshall. Despite this, they are able to finally secure their dream apartment, in Dowisetrepla, only to discover it is in a bad
location (DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt) and more poorly constructed than they thought (the floor is tilted).

[Stella (Sarah Chalke), a dermatologist he sees to remove an embarrassing butterfly tattoo. This culminates in a "two-minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Chalke)

he comforts her following a break-up with a past Canadian love; Ted is infuriated, and decides to stop being friends with Barney.
[Meanwhile, an unknown woman begins to sabotage Barney's attempts to hook up. His saboteur is revealed to be Abby (Britney](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hook_up)
[Spears), Stella's receptionist, with a vendetta against him for not calling her after they had sex.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears)

In the season finale, Ted gets into a car accident and ends up in hospital after breaking up with Stella. Subsequently, Barney is hit
by a bus while he is on his way to visit Ted and receives treatment in the same hospital. Ted realizes Barney cares about him and

[Jones), the father of her daughter. Barney struggles with his feelings for Robin as his company shifts him to the management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Jones_(actor))
team of a new acquisition, Goliath National Bank (GNB), where Marshall has accepted a position.

Marshall and Lily move to their new apartment and debate over whether or not they are ready to have kids. Robin is threatened to
be deported for not having a job in her field, which opens an opportunity for Barney to spend time with Robin. Robin gets a job
as an anchor for a 4 AM news show after Barney submits her video resume, and becomes roommates with Ted. Ted and Robin
decide to sleep together constantly so they will not fight over each other's bad co-living habits. Barney attempts to make them
stop fighting to prevent this, revealing to Ted his love for Robin.

Ted finds out Lily has sabotaged all of his relationships with anyone she does not approve of and indirectly may have inspired his
breakup with Robin. Robin and Ted end up talking about it, causing their friendship to begin moving toward a positive note.
After Barney finally sleeps with his 200th woman (and rubs it in the face of the childhood bully who taunted him into pursuing
it), he begins to question the purpose of the remainder of his life, leaving him more certain of his feelings for Robin. Barney
secures Ted a job to design the new Goliath National Bank headquarters. When the company later suspends the project, Marshall
and Barney try to hide this fact from Ted. Ted starts his own architectural design company, Mosbius Designs, after getting laid
off; however, he is too afraid of failing and refuses to call clients.

Ted, while carrying the yellow umbrella, bumps into Stella and Tony. Tony later decides to visit him, sympathizing with Ted over
[his loss of Stella. Tony offers Ted a job as a professor of architecture at Columbia University, which Ted initially turns down.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University)

In the season finale Robin finds out that Barney loves her, and initially refuses to commit to anything but a sex-only relationship;
they seemingly end up together anyway. Ted decides that being an architect is leading nowhere, and finally decides instead to
become a college professor. The finale ends with Ted preparing to teach his first class and Future Ted revealing to his children
that one of the women in the class is their mother.

[Elliott), who was absent during her childhood, makes an appearance at Thanksgiving. Mickey and Lily are able to mend their](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Elliott)
relationship at the end of the meal, where Marshall uses his fourth slap on Barney. Ted discovered that Tony, who stole Stella
away from Ted at the altar, wrote a movie on Ted and Stella's relationship. The movie, "The Wedding Bride," portrays Tony as
the hero and Ted as the villain. The movie becomes popular and Ted unexpectedly sees it while on a date with another girl. He is
[infuriated by how he is portrayed in the movie, and views the actual story as the complete opposite. Ted buys a house, which](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Wreckers)
needs to be fixed up badly, but is later revealed to be the future home for him and his children.

[Lily and Marshall are still unsure about having children. After watching four doppelgangers of their group (Lesbian Robin,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger)
[Moustache Marshall, Stripper Lily and Mexican Wrestler Ted) they decide to leave the big decision to the universe's "infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moustache)
wisdom" and start trying when they have seen Barney's doppelganger.

In the season finale, Barney disguises himself to have sex with a girl from every country in the world, and Lily and Marshall
mistake him for the final doppelganger. When Marshall finds out, he decides not to tell Lily, fearing she will want to wait even
longer to have children. Lily eventually finds out and decides to wait. Lily thinks she sees Barney's doppelganger as a hot dog
vendor, which causes the group to realize she is seeing what she wants to see, and play along. Eventually Barney agrees having
babies is not a stupid idea and Lily and Marshall should go forth. The season ends with Lily asking Marshall to "put a baby in my
belly".

girlfriend whom she later marries. After prodding by Barney, Ted is eventually hired by GNB once more as the architect of the
bank's new headquarters, which was originally scrapped in Season 4. However, he encounters opposition when he meets Zoey
[Pierson (Jennifer Morrison), a woman who is protesting against GNB for selecting a decrepit hotel, the Arcadian, to be torn down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Morrison)
for the headquarters. Over the season, Ted's encounters with Zoey eventually blossom into a relationship after she divorces her
[rich husband, the Captain (Kyle MacLachlan). However, when their relationship is challenging and turbulent, they break up,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_MacLachlan)
leading to Ted supporting the Arcadian's demolition.

Having agreed to conceive a baby at the end of the previous season, Lily and Marshall keep having sex, hoping she will get
pregnant. Around Christmas, they have a false alarm and later seek fertility testing. The fertility specialist, Dr. Stangel, turns out
to be Barney's doppelganger, fulfilling their promise with the universe in regard to their decision to have a child. However,
tragedy strikes when Marshall's father passes away, leaving him devastated and the gang comforting him. Marshall tries to get
over his father's death and live again. Despite a pledge to Lily to work harder for their future, Marshall resigns from GNB and
follows his dream of being an environmental lawyer. Zoey also hires him as her lawyer in what became a futile battle to save the
Arcadian.

Barney finally admits to the gang that Bob Barker is not his real father, especially when his mother decides to sell the house he
grew up in and his brother, James, meets his own father. Loretta offers the identity of Barney's father on a sheet of paper, but
Barney tears this up after realizing her efforts as a single mother. At the funeral of Marshall's father, Barney tells Loretta that he
[wants to see his father at last. The man, Jerry Whittaker (John Lithgow), is eventually revealed to be someone whom Barney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lithgow)
thought was his uncle. Barney, who remembers Jerry as a fun-loving man, is disappointed after learning how Jerry has grown out
of his free-wheeling ways. Although he tries to bring back Jerry's old behaviors, Barney admits that he wants to settle down
[someday. He is also introduced to Nora (Nazanin Boniadi), a co-worker of Robin, for whom he develops feelings. After an initial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazanin_Boniadi)
falling out, the two reconcile at the end of the season after Barney asks her for coffee.

Robin continues to work at her talk show, Come On, Get Up, New York!, but the presence of a new hyperactive co-host forces her
to leave. She is accepted as a researcher in another network, World Wide News. The gang also discovers more of her past as the
[Canadian pop star Robin Sparkles. Robin also encounters a man (Michael Trucco) she has had a secret crush on since first seeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Trucco)
him when she and Ted were dating, and Future Ted hints that they will see more of him later.

In the season finale, Ted makes the decision that he wants to get back with Zoey. Robin and Barney try to stop them from getting
back together. Marshall's interview goes wrong as food poisoning hits him during the meeting; Lily's similar sickness was
[thought to be food poisoning as well, but is revealed to be morning sickness, as she has become pregnant. Barney and Robin get](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_sickness)
closure by helping Ted not get back together with Zoey. Short scenes during the season premiere and finale feature a wedding set
sometime in the future, where Ted will meet his future wife. In the final scene of the season, the groom is revealed to be Barney.

bride. In the present, Marshall gets a job in environmental law while Lily's pregnancy progresses. Barney proves to Nora that he
can be a good boyfriend to her, while Robin is revealed to still have feelings for Barney. After a court case for assault, Robin
[receives mandated therapy. Robin meets a therapist, Kevin (Kal Penn), and they start to date. Meanwhile, after a period of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal_Penn)
unemployment since leaving GNB, Marshall finally manages to land his dream job at a top environmental law firm. After losing
a bet, Barney is forced to wear a tie with a duck pattern on it (nicknamed the 'Ducky Tie') which he hates. Marshall allows him to
take it off when meeting Nora's parents on the condition that Barney has three slaps added to the one still remaining from the

Marshall and Lily begin a new family with their baby, Marvin. Barney proposes to Quinn performing an extravagant magic trick
in airport security. Ted contacts his old girlfriend Victoria; unhappy with her own impending wedding, she leaves her fiancé for

break up with their partners. Victoria splits up with Ted over his friendship with Robin, Barney and Quinn break up due to their
inability to trust each other, and Robin breaks up with Nick realizing his immaturity. Robin and Barney kiss but decide not to get
[together, despite Barney's wishes. Barney then begins dating Robin's hated co-worker Patrice (Ellen D. Williams), a relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_D._Williams)

Feeling guilty, Ted realizes he cannot be around Barney and Robin after they are married and decides to move to Chicago the day
after the wedding. The season concludes with everyone traveling to Barney and Robin's wedding, including the mother of Ted's

### Season 9

With the exception of the last episode, the entirety of season nine takes place in the 56 hours leading up to Barney and Robin's
wedding.

Marshall, who is stuck in Minnesota, desperately tries to find a way to get to the wedding in time. Meanwhile, in Farhampton,
the time is slowly counting down to the wedding, with a new problem arising in almost every episode. It is revealed that Lily is
pregnant and that she and Marshall will have a daughter. It is also revealed that Ted's children are named Penny and Luke. In the
200th episode, the Mother's eight years before meeting Ted are revealed, while later episodes give viewers a glimpse of Ted and

apology present for missing the rehearsal dinner, and the second when Barney begins to panic just before the beginning of the
wedding ceremony.

fathering a child during a one-night stand. Marshall eventually becomes a judge, and he and Lily have three children. Ted's wife,
whose name is revealed to be Tracy McConnell, dies of an unknown illness in 2024, six years prior to the time of Ted telling his
children the full story of how they met. Upon finishing the story, at the urging of his kids, Ted decides to ask Robin out. Alluding
[to the first episode, the finale ends with Robin, as she looks out of her apartment window to see Ted holding the blue french horn,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(How_I_Met_Your_Mother))
smiling with tears in her eyes.

Following backlash from fans over the ending of the series, an alternative ending was cut together and released on the Season 9
DVD, in which future Ted narrates over the scene in which Ted and Tracy meet at the train station, recapping all major events
from the series. He delivers the final line "and that kids is how I met your mother", and the episode ends, completely cutting the
final scene with Penny and Luke.

## Critical reception

The first season was met with generally favorable reviews from critics, although some compared the series unfavorably to
_[Friends. On Metacritic, a review aggregation site that collected 25 reviews for the series, it scored a 69 out of 100.[[49]] Michael](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends)_
Abernethy of _[PopMatters gave the season a negative review, writing that "The comedy that does occur in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PopMatters)_ _How I Met Your_
_[Mother isn't enough to compensate for its inconsistencies."[[50]] Tom Shales of The Washington Post gave the season a lukewarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post)_
review, saying it's "a little better than most other sitcoms, past and present -- especially those featuring wacky urban friends in
[their twenties experiencing the bittersweet mysteries of life."[[51]] Melanie Macfarlane of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer gave the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Post-Intelligencer)
season a positive review, saying the show "may not break any comedic ground, but it's the sort of comfortable, reliable hitter
CBS needs on Monday nights."[[52]]

[The second season received critical acclaim. Staci Krause of IGN gave the season a positive review,[[53]] calling it "great".[[54]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN)

The third season was met with mostly positive reviews.[[55]] Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave the season a positive review, saying
that "the season was fun and clever, a good, consistent flow from the first two seasons".[[56]]

[The fourth season received critical acclaim. Michelle Zoromski of IGN gave Season 4 an overall rating of 8.5 out of 10, stating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN)
that "This fourth season seemed to settle down the chase for the titular mother. While Ted was busy dating Stella, the gang settled
into many stand alone episodes which were every bit as entertaining as episodes devoted to Ted's love life". Zoromski went on to
[say: "A stellar Robin-Marshall episode, titled 'Little Minnesota', makes it clear that these two do not get enough screen time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Minnesota)
together. With Robin homesick and unemployed (and at risk of being deported), this pairing brought out the best Robin Sparkles
[reference of the season, when Marshall leads a rousing karaoke version of 'Let's Go to the Mall!' "[[57]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Go_to_the_Mall)

[The fifth season received mixed reviews. Cindy McLennan of Television Without Pity gave the season a mixed review, and at the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Without_Pity)
end of the season wrote: "I'm okay with any given season not being primarily focused on mother-meeting, but this season, the
characters seemed to regress -- particularly Barney and Ted. Usually, when a season ends, I have to deal with a week or two
weeks' worth of letdown. Right now, all I'm feeling is relief."[[58]]

The sixth season received generally positive reviews.[[59]] Justin Fowler of _Later Reviews gave the season a positive review,_
saying that the season was "a pretty good season of television" and better than the "poor" fifth season. He also said that
"Seventeen out of the 24 episodes are what I would consider good".[[60]]

The seventh season received mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards
throughout the season, saying that "the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the
past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians trying to keep the audience from figuring out how the trick works.
And the finale affirmed that belief for me. The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good; the parts
that were all about the future made me roll my eyes and ask, for the umpteenth time, 'Really? This is where you're going with
this?' "[[61]]

[The eighth season received mixed reviews and is often considered the worst season of the series. Rotten Tomatoes reported that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes)
54% of critics gave the show a positive review. The consensus reads: "How I Met Your Mother wears out its welcome this season,
with an anticlimactic reveal and rote, less-than-fruitful humor."[[62]]

The ninth season received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, though fans found it worse than prior seasons.[[63]] Rotten
Tomatoes reported that 80% of critics gave the show a positive review, with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10.[[64]] Gareth
Mitchell at "House of Geekery" responded negatively, mostly criticizing the structure of the season, stating that they are


-----

The finale of the show received a largely negative reaction from critics and fans. Some complained that the last few seasons
(particularly the final season before the finale which took place over one weekend) had built towards an end game that was
discarded within the hour-long episode, while others defended it as true to both the initial concept of the show and to life
itself.[[66]] In the years succeeding its airing, it continued to be singled out as one of the worst television series finales,[[67][68][69]]

[e.g., topping USA Today's list of "Worst Series Finales of All Time".[[70]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today)

## Subplots

### The Slap Bet

[It is in Season 2, episode 9, named "Slap Bet"[[71]] when viewers are introduced to what is a slap bet, as explained by Marshall to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slap_Bet)
Lily. The first slap bet of the series is made in this episode when Ted is adamant on discovering why Robin refuses to go to
malls.[[72]] In response Barney is positive that Robin is hiding pornography that she has starred in, while Marshall believes Robin
is married. This is when Barney suggests a slap bet instead of betting money, Marshall explains that "whoever is right gets to slap
the other person in the face as hard as they can -- but no rings". Lily initially believes it is immature until Marshall states she can
be slap bet commissioner. Ted continues to badger Robin about why she refuses to go to malls, and when trying to figure out if
she was married, Robin lies and says she was married. When Ted tells the group that Robin is married, Marshall preemptively
slaps Barney. Marshall then tries to look up Robin's marital records at his law school library, and it is revealed that Robin lied.
Eventually Marshall tells Lily, so Lily as slap bet commissioner imparts a slap penalty allowing Barney to slap Marshall three
times, one for lying about finding out the truth and two for the premature slap.[[73]] Barney then discovers someone that has the
[tape with proof of Robin's secret, a man in Malaysia, and he has posted the video onto MySpace. When Barney plays the video,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySpace)
he stops the video at a seemingly suggestive part and believing he has won the bet he slaps Marshall.[[74]] Robin then to show that

### Spin-offs

**_How I Met Your Dad_**

On November 15, 2013, it was announced that CBS and the series' producer 20th Television would launch How I Met Your Dad,
[a woman-centric variation executive-produced by Bays, Thomas, and Emily Spivey.[[108]] The new series would possibly have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Spivey)
featured a new bar and would not have tied into the original series.[[109]] The primary cast of the series was revealed on March 14,
[2014, to be Greta Gerwig, Drew Tarver, Nicholas D'Agosto, Krysta Rodriguez and Andrew Santino.[[110]] Tiya Sircar was cast not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Gerwig)
[long after on March 26, 2014, replacing Krysta Rodriguez's role in the series.[[111]] On April 23, 2014, Meg Ryan was announced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meg_Ryan)
to voice future Sally.[[112]]

On May 14, 2014, CBS passed on picking up How I Met Your Dad since show creators Craig Thomas and Carter Bays did not
[want to reshoot the pilot.[[113]] Nina Tassler, the entertainment president at CBS, stated that "there were elements of the pilot that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nina_Tassler)
[didn't work out". Talks of the series being "shopped" to other networks emerged.[[113][114]] Netflix, FOX and NBC were named as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix)
possible candidates for picking up the show.[[115]]

Ultimately, nothing came of those talks. It was reported that the options on the cast contracts had expired and they had been
released from their contracts and co-creator Carter Bays denied any rumors that the spin-off pilot will be reshot. On July 11,
2014, Bays confirmed that the spin-off project was officially dead.[[116]] Six days later, Nina Tassler said that CBS would "love the
opportunity to take another shot" at the pilot and that she would continue to "hound" Carter Bays and Craig Thomas, even though
they shot down the idea of a new version of the project stating that they had both moved on.[[117]]

In 2016, two years after the project was announced "dead", a full script of the pilot episode was leaked online.[[118]] In 2020, the
[full pilot episode was also leaked by a Reddit user on the How I Met Your Mother subreddit, which included a modified ending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subreddit)
compared to the leaked script from 2016.

**_How I Met Your Father_**

On December 14, 2016, it was reported that Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger were set to write a new version of the previous
spin-off's pilot, re-titled How I Met Your Father, with Bays and Thomas serving as executive producers.[[119]] On March 6, 2017,
it was announced that following signing new contracts with 20th Television that would see both Aptaker and Berger being
promoted to executive producers and co-showrunners on _[This Is Us alongside Dan Fogelman, their completed spec script for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Us)_
_How I Met Your Father would be placed on the back burner in light of their new duties.[[120]]_

[On August 8, 2017, Fox chairman Dana Walden told](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Walden) _[Deadline that the studio was set to try a third attempt at a spin-off with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood)_
different writers due to the unavailability of Aptaker and Berger. It was also stated that all ideas from the previous two attempts
are not carried over and the new attempt are created from scratch.[[121]] On August 11, 2017, Deadline reported that Alison
Bennett had been selected to write the spin-off. It was also confirmed that this incarnation would be developed under the title
used for the Aptaker and Berger project, and that Bays and Thomas are once again attached as executive producers.[[122]]

[On April 21, 2021, it was announced that the spin-off series was ordered by Hulu, with Hilary Duff attached to play lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu)
character Sophie. Aptaker and Berger would helm the project as creators, writers, and executive producers.[[123]] On June 16,
[2021, Chris Lowell was announced to have joined the cast in a starring role.[[124]] On August 10, 2021, Francia Raisa, Tom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lowell)
[Ainsley, Tien Tran and Suraj Sharma joined the cast in a starring roles.[[125]] On August 30, 2021, Daniel Augustin joined the cast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suraj_Sharma)
[in a recurring role, replacing Brandon Micheal Hall, who exited the project due to scheduling conflicts.[[126]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Micheal_Hall)

[On January 18, 2022, How I Met Your Father began streaming on Hulu in the US, Disney+ internationally and Star+ in Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Father)
America.

In September 2023, the show was cancelled after 2 seasons.[[127]]
